# Exploration: Antigravity Compound Engineering Plugin Integration

## Question

**Which features from Antigravity Compound Engineering Plugin is Gemini-Kit missing, and how should they be integrated?**

## Time-box

- **Duration**: 30 minutes
- **Success Criteria**: Full list of missing features and integration plan

## Findings

### 1. Feature Comparison Matrix

| Feature | Compound Plugin | Gemini-Kit | Gap |
|---------|----------------|------------|-----|
| **Multi-agent system** | ❌ None | ✅ 15 agents | GK has it |
| **Workflows** | ✅ 27 workflows | ✅ 32 workflows (copied) | ✅ Already has |
| **Scripts automation** | ✅ 50+ scripts | ✅ 50+ scripts (copied) | ✅ Already has |
| **Skills system** | ✅ 7 modular skills | ✅ 7 skills (copied) | ✅ Already has |
| **Knowledge Base** | ✅ docs/solutions/ | ✅ docs/solutions/ (copied) | ✅ Already has |
| **Critical Patterns** | ✅ 23 patterns | ❌ None | 🔴 **MISSING** |
| **Health Dashboard** | ✅ compound-dashboard.sh | ✅ Already has | ✅ Already has |
| **Telemetry/Metrics** | ✅ .agent/metrics/ | ⚠️ Has but not setup | 🟡 **PARTIAL** |
| **GEMINI.md Protocol** | ✅ Compound-focused | ✅ Agent-focused | 🟡 **NEEDS MERGE** |
| **Schema Validation** | ✅ schema.yaml | ❌ None | 🔴 **MISSING** |
| **Explorations docs** | ✅ docs/explorations/ | ⚠️ Just created | 🟡 **PARTIAL** |
| **Specs system** | ✅ docs/specs/ | ❌ None | 🔴 **MISSING** |

### 2. Missing Features Analysis

#### 🔴 Critical Missing (MUST HAVE)

##### 2.1 Critical Patterns Registry
- **What**: File `docs/decisions/patterns/critical-patterns.md` with 23 patterns
- **Why important**: "Antibodies" against repeating errors
- **Action**: Create file with patterns suitable for Gemini-Kit

##### 2.2 Schema Validation (schema.yaml)
- **What**: YAML schema to validate solution documents
- **Why important**: Ensure Knowledge Base consistency
- **Action**: Create `docs/solutions/schema.yaml`

##### 2.3 Specs System
- **What**: Multi-session specification management
- **Why important**: Manage large initiatives across multiple sessions
- **Action**: Create `docs/specs/` with template

#### 🟡 Partial (SHOULD HAVE)

##### 2.4 GEMINI.md Enhancement
- **What**: Merge compound protocols into existing GEMINI.md
- **Why important**: Agents need to know when to search solutions, compound, etc.
- **Action**: Update GEMINI.md with compound behaviors

##### 2.5 Telemetry Setup
- **What**: .agent/metrics/, .agent/logs/ full setup
- **Why important**: Track health and usage
- **Action**: Create directories and gitkeep

##### 2.6 Architecture Docs
- **What**: docs/architecture/compound-system.md
- **Why important**: Document how the system works
- **Action**: Create architecture documentation

---

### 3. Multi-Order Consequences Analysis

#### 1st Order (Immediate)
- Add new files/directories
- Update GEMINI.md
- Agents start following compound protocols

#### 2nd Order (Dependencies)
- Agents will search solutions before coding → reduce duplicate work
- Agents will document solutions after finishing → knowledge grows
- Health checks will track progress

#### 3rd Order (Cascading)
- Knowledge Base grows exponentially
- Each session more productive with prior knowledge
- Patterns prevent recurring mistakes

#### 4th Order (Long-term)
- Gemini-Kit becomes self-improving
- New contributors onboard faster
- Best practices automatically enforced

---

### 4. Stakeholder Impact

| Stakeholder | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------------|--------|------------|
| **User** | New commands added, need to learn | Clear docs |
| **Agent** | Many new behaviors | Update GEMINI.md |
| **Codebase** | ~20 files added | Organized structure |

---

### 5. Reversibility Assessment

- **Type 2 Decision** (Reversible): Can remove compound features if not suitable
- **Low Risk**: Does not affect Gemini-Kit core functionality
- **Additive**: Only adds, does not modify current code

---

## Recommendations

### 🎯 Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Core Structure (5 files)
1. ✅ `docs/decisions/patterns/critical-patterns.md` - Pattern registry
2. ✅ `docs/solutions/schema.yaml` - Validation schema
3. ✅ `docs/specs/README.md` - Specs system
4. ✅ `docs/architecture/compound-system.md` - Architecture docs
5. ✅ Update `GEMINI.md` - Merge compound behaviors

#### Phase 2: Templates (3 files)
1. `docs/specs/templates/spec-template.md`
2. `docs/explorations/templates/exploration-template.md`
3. `docs/solutions/templates/solution-template.md`

#### Phase 3: Telemetry (3 directories)
1. `.agent/metrics/` with gitkeep
2. `.agent/logs/` with gitkeep
3. Update `.gitignore` for logs

## Decision Gate

**Recommend: Proceed to /plan**

We have sufficient understanding to create a detailed implementation plan for integrating the missing features.
